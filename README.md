# BLHel32GKE

BLHeli32 is closed source. 

This is partial transliteration of the main part of BLHeli-S from assembler to C. There are quite a few Brushless DC Motor controllers out there which make a far more sensible starting point of course including Open-BLDC but I was curious as to what magic if any was in BLHeli.

I do not expect to take it further but you are welcome to play yourself.
